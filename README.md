Welcome!

Our team is made up of: Moisés Palacio, Nathan Jolly and Antonio Pérez. 

Together we developed a robot car that can drive autonomously. We use two motors, one for the rear wheels and one for the steering axle. An ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and a color sensor to detect the color of the traffic lights. We use the Arduino Uno microcontroller for our project.
