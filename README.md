The Robotic Clan
==
Welcome!

Our team is made up of: Moisés Palacio, Nathan Jolly and Antonio Pérez. 

Together we developed a robot car that can drive autonomously. We use two motors, one for the rear wheels and one for the steering axle. An ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and a color sensor to detect the color of the traffic lights. We use the Arduino Uno microcontroller for our project.

models in this directory you will find the 3D modeled files for the assembly of the robot and its components.

other in this directory you will find additional files of the robot operation, process diagram and execution.

schemes contains a schematic diagram in PNG format of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they are connected to each other.

src contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition.

t-photos contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members).

v-photos contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom).

video contains the video.mp4 file with the robot driving demonstration.
